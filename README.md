GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls two dices as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score.
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- A player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 6 in a row (two 6s in the  same time is OK). After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach 100 points (or any max score the players chose at the beginning) on GLOBAL score wins the game.
